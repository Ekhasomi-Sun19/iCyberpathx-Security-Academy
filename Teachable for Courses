What if i'm using the teachable tool to create my course curriculum and lesson video, how can I then connect it to my website to make it available to users using my website?

Great question 👍

If you’re using Teachable to actually host your courses, curriculum, and videos, you don’t have to rebuild the entire course system from scratch — instead, you integrate Teachable with your own website. Here are the main ways you can do that:

🔗 1. Direct Linking / Embedding

Each Teachable course/lesson has its own course URL.

On your React website, you can:

Add buttons like “View Course” → send users to your Teachable course page.

Or, if you want it inside your website, you can use an iframe embed to display the course inside your own site.

<iframe 
  src="https://your-school.teachable.com/p/your-course" 
  width="100%" 
  height="800px" 
  style={{ border: "none" }}
/>


This is the quickest integration, but it feels less “native.”

🔑 2. Custom Domain Integration

Teachable allows you to map your own domain (e.g., courses.mywebsite.com) so your users feel like they’re still inside your brand.

You can configure Teachable so that all course access is on courses.mywebsite.com, while your main React website remains separate (www.mywebsite.com).

⚡ 3. Single Sign-On (SSO)

If you want users to log in once on your React site and automatically be logged into Teachable:

Teachable supports SSO via OAuth/JWT for advanced plans.

You’d authenticate users on your website, then pass them into Teachable with an SSO token.

This way, users don’t need two accounts.

📡 4. Teachable API / Zapier

Teachable has an API that lets you:

Enroll users in courses programmatically.

Fetch course info.

Manage student accounts.

Example: A user signs up on your React site → backend calls Teachable API → user is automatically created in your Teachable school and enrolled in a course.

Alternatively, you can use Zapier to connect your site to Teachable without heavy coding.

🎯 Which to choose?

If you want fastest setup → use direct linking or iframe embedding.

If you want branding under your own domain → use custom domain integration.

If you want full control & seamless UX → use Teachable API + SSO (more work, but professional).

👉 Do you want me to show you a React example where clicking a course in your own curriculum UI will either:

Open the Teachable course in an iframe, OR

Redirect the user to your Teachable-hosted course page?
